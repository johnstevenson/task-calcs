Technical specification for CIVL flight recorders. The official release version is available from https://www.fai.org/civl-documents 

## About

This repo contains the source text in [asciidoc][asciidoc] format, to make it easier to work with rather than sharing a Word document.

See [civl-fr-spec.adoc](civl-fr-spec.adoc), which is the specification rendered by the Github interface (click the `Raw` button to see plain text).

Note that the `master` branch will not necessarily reflect the current version.
